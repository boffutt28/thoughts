# Overview
This repository is meant to be a collection of writings on all things related to open source and infrastructure. The intent is to provide a single collection point that allows for feedback and conversation. My hope is that by posting here as opposed to blogging others can add their thoughts as well. The collective conciousess is nearly always a better one than the individual. I will also be keeping a copy of all writings on a separate platform for those who do not wish to read via GH, which is TBD.
